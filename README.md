## Lessons Learned

In this project, I need to verify a lot of documentation to recreate the best way to show and include To-Do activities.
I needed verify example project to know how access values into variables and how modify compose functions like tabbar or a floating button.

In the future, I will try to include a webservice to save the information sent and recovery it.
